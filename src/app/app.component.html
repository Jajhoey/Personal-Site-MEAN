    <p>My name is John Hoey, I am a recent graduate from St. John's University.
      My strengths include mathematics, object oriented programming,
      and web design. A dream job for me would be a position where I would
      create apps that incorporate AI programming/machine learning. I hope to create websites
      where users can form a better understanding of the utility and practicality
      of these fields for themselves! </p>
